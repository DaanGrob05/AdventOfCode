# Advent of Code 2023

This is my Advent of Code 2023 repository. I will be using TypeScript and bun to solve the problems.
I am also using this as a way to learn the [Prog Dvorak Prime](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards) keyboard layout.

# Bun 2023

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.15. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
